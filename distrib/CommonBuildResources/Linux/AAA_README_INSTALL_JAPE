How to install Jape
-------------------

You should have InstallJape.sh, and this file (AAA_README_INSTALL_JAPE).

1. If your system lets you double-click executable files (shell scripts) to execute them, 
   you are well set up. Go on to step 5.
   
2. If you don't mind (or prefer) the command-line interface, then you are fine. Go on to 
   step 5.
   
3. If you are on Ubuntu Linux and you'd like double-click executable files (such as
   InstallJape.sh), then in a command window type
   
       gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences executable-text-activation 'launch'
       
   and go to step 5.
   
4. If you are on some other kind of Linux, search the web for instructions on how to 
   set up your system to execute shell scripts with a double-click. Or else you are 
   stuck with the command-line interface.
   
5. Now: double-click InstallJape.sh (or do the equivalent command). You will be left 
   with a directory of examples, and an executable file Jape, plus the original 
   InstallJape.sh (which you can delete if you like). 
   
6. When Jape runs on Ubuntu, it will put an icon in the taskbar. Add it to your favourites
   (control-press and choose 'Add to Favourites') to make it easier to run Jape the next 
   time. 
   
7. On other Linuxes, you may have to double-click the Jape file each time you run Jape.
   If you find a better way, please let me know.
