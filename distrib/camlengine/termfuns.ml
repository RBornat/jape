   A 'meta variable' is an implicitly (meta-) quantified
   variable which occurs in a rule or theorem. We look for them
   in (at least) the following situations:
   
     when matching terms (for example in the UNFOLD/FOLD search)
     when doing LET bindings
     when (in EVALUATE) finding the fresh unknowns and object variables
     in a sequent (things which appear in the consequent but not in
     the hypothesis).
   
   An operator or an identifier which has been declared to be a constant
   can not be a meta variable.
   
   An identifier which has been declared to be of
   some identifier CLASS is a meta variable.
   
   The implementation of Symbol distinguishes
   between CONSTANT foo and CLASS CONSTANT foo only by
   making the former answer false to isextensibleID whereas
   the latter answers true.

 (* This thing needed a rewrite, because it was obscure and uncommented and didn't
  * work.  So it got one.  Here is what it does, and there are comments about how it
  * does it. (Please note that the treatment here was developed before the
  * introduction of 'hidden provisos' generated from the interpretation of binding
  * structures and predicate notation. That later treatment means that some of the
  * data gathered here is over-cautious, but that doesn't matter, because when we
  * have a proviso saying that two names are independent, we believe it no matter
  * what the data structure prepared here says.  However, steps 3 and 4 below are 
  * far too conservative when we are interpreting predicates, and lead to far too 
  * many binders being treated as 'bad'.  So we have added a parameter which 
  * details those NOTIN provisos which are in force.)
  * 
  * The data structure built here is added to the context by rewritecxt (see
  * rewrite.sml).  It's interpreted in exterioreqvarsq (see facts.sml).
  * 
  * We get (indirectly from varbindings) a list of names, each paired with a list of
  * binding contexts; each binding context is a list of lists of names.  Each element
  * of a binding context is a 'parallel binding' - what you get from something like
  * Ax,y.P.  So if you have Ax,y.Eu,v.P what is recorded for P is the binding context
  * [[u,v],[x,y]].
  * 
  * Now the question that we want to solve is this: are there names in the 'exterior'
  * of a theorem/derived rule -- that is, in the base sequent plus any givens --
  * which can be treated as independent, because if we get an instance of the theorem
  * or rule in which they happen to be the same, we can alpha-convert them apart?
  * 
  * We solve this question by constructing a data structure which tells us the names
  * that are not necessarily independent.  Unfortunately the question applies not
  * only to variables like x, y, z but also to formulas like P, Q, R.  That
  * complicates the issue: we need to know not only when x and z can be considered
  * distinct, but also when x can be considered not to occur free in P.  Luckily
  * these questions are closely related, but it does mean that you have to pay rather
  * close attention to some details.
  * 
  * Step 1. Clearly, names which appear free are not independendent. So we should
  *     accumulate names which appear free.  We can add to the free names those
  *     formula names which appear bound: if we have free z and also we have Ax.P,
  *     then we can't say that z doesn't appear free in P.
  * 
  * Step 2. If we have Ax.P, then clearly P may contain occurrences of x: we record a
  *     relation between binders like x and the names which they 'dominate' like P.
  * 
  * Step 3. If we have Ax.Ay.P(x,y) and also Ay.Ax.P(x,y) then there is a problem. We
  *     can envisage an instance of the theorem/rule in which x and y happen to be
  *     the same, but then we won't be able to alpha-convert them apart, because in
  *     one case the ys are captured and in the other the xs are captured.  So if
  *     there is one binding in which x dominates y and another in which y dominates
  *     x, both pairs are added to the mapping of step 2.
  * 
  * Step 4. If we have Ax.P and Ay.P then y can occur free (case 1) and so can x
  *     (case 2).  This doesn't apply, clearly, to Ax.z and Ay.z, so we restrict it
  *     to cases in which what is dominated isn't a variable.  Anyway, if we find it
  *     we add x and y to the list of 'free' variables from step 1.
  * 
  * The result is a list of 'free' variables -- if two names are in that list then
  * they can't be judged independent -- plus a 'dominates' relation -- if x dominates
  * P then x NOTIN P can't be ignored.  But if x and y are two variables which aren't
  * both in the 'free' variable list and neither dominates the other, then they can
  * be treated as independent and distinct.  And if x and P aren't both in the free
  * variable list and x doesn't dominate P, then x NOTIN P can be considered
  * satisfied.  And that's really the point: to allow simplification of substitutions
  * involving schematic but different names like x and y, and to eliminate provisos
  * ditto.
