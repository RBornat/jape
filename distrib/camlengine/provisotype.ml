type proviso = 
  | FreshProviso of (bool * bool * bool * term)
  | UnifiesProviso of (term * term)
  | NotinProviso of (term * term)
  | NotoneofProviso of (term list * term * term)
  | DistinctProviso of term list

(* Meaning of provisos at present :
   FreshProviso (h, g, r, v)     : Variable v doesn't occur free in hypotheses (if h), 
                                   conclusions (if g); non-principal formulae only (if r)
   UnifiesProviso (t1, t2)       : t1 must unify with t2.
   NotinProviso (v, t)           : variable v must not occur free in t
   DistinctProviso vs            : the variables vs are distinct. Equivalent to n*(n-1) 
                                   NotinProvisos
   NotoneofProviso (vs, pat, _C) : in any element of collection _C that matches pat,
                                   variables vs don't occur in the places indicated
                                   by pat.
