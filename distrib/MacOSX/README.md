# README for Jape 9.0.*

(The Jape version is shown in the Jape splash screen -- the window which comes up when you start Jape.)

## Installation

Copy Jape.app and the examples folder wherever you like. 

## Running Jape

The first time you run Jape, you will find that double-clicking it doesn't work, because we (Richard Bornat and Bernard Sufrin) haven't registered as Apple developers. So Ctrl-press on it, and choose Open from the pop-up menu, and say you trust us.

After that you can just double-click Jape to run it. 

## Choose a font

In the distant past there were few fonts that included lots of Unicode characters like the ones that Jape uses for logical connectives. So we found one that seemed to be free(-ish) called *Lucida Sans Unicode*, and we recommended people to download it. But it wasn't as free as we thought (it belongs to Microsoft), and it isn't in modern distributions of macOS. And in any case it was a sans-serif font, so it doesn't show the difference between 1 (digit 1) and l (lower-case L) very well. 

So when you start Jape, go to Preferences in the Jape menu and choose a nice font. On my machine I quite like Cambria Math, but YMMV. Jape will, of course, remember what you choose.

## Choose a theory

At present you have to open a theory file (.jt extension) through Jape's File menu (File>Open... or File>Open new theory...). The examples directory contains lots of example theories. The one I use in the Proof and Disproof book is `examples/natural_deduction/I2L.jt` .

## Have fun

The point of Jape is to enable you to play in logic or play with logic. The examples directory contains logic encodings ('theories') that Bernard Sufrin and I have made. The github repository contains manuals in case you want to play with an encoding of your own.

## That book

Oxford University Press let me put a [version online](https://homepages.phonecoop.coop/randj/richard/books/ProofandDisproof.pdf).
