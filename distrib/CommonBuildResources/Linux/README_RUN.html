<h2 id="how-to-run-jape">How to run Jape</h2>
<p>You have unpacked <code>LinuxJape.tgz</code> to give a directory <code>LinuxJape</code>, and launched <code>LinuxJape/installJape.sh</code>. In <code>LinuxJape</code> there should now remain an examples directory, this file, and <code>runJape.sh</code>.</p>
<p>If you double-clicked <code>installJape.sh</code> to install Jape, double-click <code>runJape.sh</code>. If you used the command line, just execute <code>runJape.sh</code>. Either way, Jape will run and show its control window. From the control window’s File menu, open the Jape logic theory you want to work with (e.g. <code>examples/natural deduction/I2L.jt</code>.)</p>
<p>When Jape runs on Ubuntu, it will put its icon in the taskbar. Add it to your favourites (right-click and choose ‘Add to Favourites’) so you can double-click it to run Jape in the future.</p>
<p>On other Linuxes, you may have to launch from <code>runJape.sh</code> each time you run Jape. If you find a better way, please let me know.</p>
