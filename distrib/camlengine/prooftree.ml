    (* A new means of addressing the tree, to serve the needs of the CUTIN tactic, which
     * inserts cuts low down in a tree.
     *
     * A cut inserted into a tree produces two new nodes, and wrecks all paths to nodes
     * above it, if we use the old nth-subtree way of describing a path. But it is essential
     * that old paths continue to work -- think of goals, targets, paths stored by
     * LETGOALPATH, and maybe other things as well -- so we can't use that old navigation system.
     *
     * Luckily a cut introduces exactly two unique elements into a proof: the conclusion element
     * and the hypothesis element. They can be used to label the two new nodes uniquely. If
     * we include them in paths, they have to be negative numbers.  I rely on the fact that 
     * resources are never zero, so that addresses of the two new nodes are just negative numbers.
     *
     * Then there is a choice: which are the two new nodes?  The apparently obvious choice is
     * to label the left subtree with the conclusion resource, the right with the hypothesis
     * resource.  But that doesn't work, because if we do a CUTIN at a tip, having recorded
     * the path to the tip for some reason, the old path would lead to the root of the internal
     * cut, not the reconstructed tip.  So the conclusion resource labels the left subtree, 
     * and the hypothesis resource labels the cut node itself.  Odd, but (given considerable 
     * ingenuity in the design of algorithms) it works.  Drawback: it makes comparison of paths
     * (e.g. by looking at prefixes) almost impossible.  Sorry.
     * 
     * To make old paths work, we skip to the right subtree if we are addressing
     * an inner cut node with a path that doesn't start with the right or left subtree label.
