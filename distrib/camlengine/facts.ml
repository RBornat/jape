(* This function is deciding whether a variable v can be made equal to some term t
   by unification and/or instatiation of parameters.  It is used in simplifySubst.
   
   Provisos, read as facts that we can depend on, make it much more possible to
   distinguish what is and isn't equal in substitutions.
   If we know that x is NOTIN v or v is NOTIN x then v and x can't be made equal.
   
   The new 'class' feature of names is more help still.  
   Information about bindings, stored in the Exterior component of the context,
   is yet further help.

(* What this function is deciding is whether there is any substitution for metavariables
      which could make equal ground terms.  It is only used in abstraction (see unify.sml).
      So we can treat Paramids as Conids without fear, and no need for parameterisation any more.
      RB 31/i/93
      
      I had believed that termoccursin was sound for use in this function, as it is 
      if it doesn't go into substitutions.  
      It doesn't seem to make a significant difference to execution times, but I haven't 
      checked that very carefully.
      
      This function will perform
      reasonably given *fully simplified* substitutions: otherwise it is dramatically 
      over-cautious.
