(* This is decaying. Behaviour of the command loop, except when recently tested, is becoming 
 * unpredictably bizarre.  This is perhaps due to the separation of concerns between interaction
 * (which deals with some commands from the interface, and translates the rest) and the command
 * loop.  pointToSequent is where a good deal of the confusion centres ...

(* There appear to be two reasonable behaviours, given a selection and a command.
 * 1. (the original) -- resolve the selection to a single tip, if possible, and work there.
 * 2. (the new and odd) -- just take exactly what was given, and damn the consequences.
 *
 * The new, odd, behaviour supports use of a box-and-line display in either forward or
 * backward mode.  It means that the user (tactic programmer) must guard against things
 * like acting at a non-tip conclusion, but that's possible now.
 *)

(* and all this leads (surprise, surprise!) to problems. Especially with LETHYPSUBSTSEL.
 * It should fail if you make a text selection which is not on the path to whatever conclusion
 * you are working towards -- but then, what should the logic encoder (the tactic programmer)
 * do? At present we assume that if LETHYPSUBSTSEL fails, either you didn't text-select anything
 * or it wasn't in a hypothesis. The sort of thing you have to write is this (from hoare_problems.j)

  * go round again with LETHYP and LETCONC and LETGOAL (can't remember the difference between
  * the last two!) and finally say that you obviously didn't select anything, so there's a problem.
  *
  * Now if we don't police text selections properly, LETHYPSUBSTSEL can succeed on a non-selected
  * hypothesis. But if we do police them a bit more, it can fail because it's on the wrong path,
  * and then the sort of error diagnostic above fails. Hmmm. Don't know what to do.
