## How to run Jape

You have unpacked `LinuxJape.tgz` to give a directory `LinuxJape`, and launched `LinuxJape/installJape.sh`. In `LinuxJape` there should now remain an examples directory, this file, and `runJape.sh`.

If you double-clicked `installJape.sh` to install Jape, double-click `runJape.sh`. If you used the command line, just execute `runJape.sh`. Either way, Jape will run and show its control window. From the control window's File menu, open the Jape logic theory you want to work with (e.g. `examples/natural deduction/I2L.jt`.)
   
When Jape runs on Ubuntu, it will put its icon in the taskbar. Add it to your favourites (right-click and choose 'Add to Favourites') so you can double-click it to run Jape in the future. 
   
On other Linuxes, you may have to launch from `runJape.sh` each time you run Jape. If you find a better way, please let me know.
