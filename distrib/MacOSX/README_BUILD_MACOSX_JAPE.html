<h1>How to build Jape on MacOS (April 2018; updated October 2019)</h1>


<p >Currently we build MacOS Jape on Sierra and High Sierra,
and use OCaml 4.07.0 and Java 1.7, 1.8, 1.11 or 1.13.  We build Linux Jape with the
same Ocaml version, but on a Linux machine.</p>



<h2> If you want to build Jape yourself</h2>


<p >1. Install the developer tools (get them from Apple; these days I think you
have to get them by installing Xcode and then asking Xcode to install them). You will also
need git, if it isn't in the developer tools.</p>


<p >2. Make sure ant (installed by the developer tools) is
known to the shell (and why Apple doesn't do this, I don't
know). I added the following lines to <tt>~/.profile</tt>:</p>


<tt><pre>
        ## ant variables added by richard 13/ii/2008 start
        ## Do not remove the previous line
        
        PATH="$PATH:/usr/share/ant/bin"
        export PATH
        ANTHOME="/usr/share/ant"
        export ANTHOME
        JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/Home"
        export JAVA_HOME
        
        ## Do not remove the next line
        ## ant variables added by richard 13/ii/2008 end
</pre></tt>



<p >3. You will need OCaml to build the jape ‘engine’ (at time of writing, in October 2019, 
Jape is built using ocaml 4.07.0; but has been known to build with ocaml 3.12)</p>


<p>3. You will need Java 1.7, 1.8, 1.11 or 1.13. Our build
system is ok with any of these; but beware that
a <tt>Jape.app</tt> made with 1.7 or 1.8 may not interoperate with the very latest
OS/X (there have been so many since High Sierra).  1.9 may
work for you (we haven't tried).</p>


<p>4. Put jarbundler-3.3.0-forjape.jar, an ant task, stored in the directory where you found this file (<tt>...../distrib/MacOSX</tt>), in the ant library
<tt>/usr/share/ant/lib</tt> (or whereever your ant library is). Delete any previous jarbundler versions.
</p>

<p>5. In the directory where you found this file (<tt>...../distrib/MacOSX</tt>):

<pre>
        <tt>make local</tt> 
</pre>

builds the engine and the GUI interface, bundles them together and puts them in <tt>./build/Jape.app</tt>

<pre>
        <tt>make run</tt> 
</pre>
lets you try it out. If it works, move <tt>build/Jape.app</tt> where you like.
</p>
