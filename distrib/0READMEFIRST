If you are planning to BUILD an installation (most people don't need to)
then read CommonBuildResources/INSTALLATIONBUILDING first.

MacOSX builders can go straight to MacOSX/README_BUILD_MACOS.html. You
might wonder why that text used to be in .rtf form. So did I.

Bernard -> Bernard: on Spartacus you can build the GUI in Linux, then
switch to the Win7 VM to do the engine build before building
the distribution jar. I've not bothered to automate the entire
Windows build, though it may only require me to install ant and javac 
in Win7. The recipe is as follows:

Make the Linux version first in the usual way
        cd ...JapeForge/distrib/
        [and if LinuxJape and WindowsJape don't already exist]
        sh CommonBuildResources/buildbuild.sh
        cd LinuxJape/build
        make distribution
        


Start the win7 image in VirtualBox. This is set up with virtual drive E: pointing
at my JapeForge distrib directory.

win7:   [open a cygwin window]
        cd /cygdrive/e/distrib/WindowsJape/build
        make engine
        ---

spartacus:
        cd ...JapeForge/distrib/WindowsJape/build
        make jarfile
        --- 

Now test the installation
       
win7:   [open a regular terminal window]
        E:
        cd distrib/WindowsJape/build
        java -jar InstallWindowsJape.jar # tell it to put a shortcut on the desktop 
        [now click on the shortcut to start Jape]
