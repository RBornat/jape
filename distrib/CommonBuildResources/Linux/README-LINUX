What to do
----------

0. Download the  InstallLinuxjape.jar file. **DO NOT DOUBLE-CLICK IT** (that unpacks
   it, and you want to execute it in the next step).

1. From a terminal window execute the jar file with

        java -jar InstallLinuxjape.jar

   This will start the interactive java installer.
   
   The installer brings up a Splash Screen on which there are
   three buttons and a log window. 

2. Once you have decided where Jape's home is going to be (and
   indicated it to the installer) just press the button labelled
   "Install".

   This starts the jape installer, which leaves the examples directory,
   the inference engine, the interface engine, and a shell script
   (Jape) that runs Jape in the installation directory..You can make
   symbolic or other links to the Jape script from anywhere in your
   filestore. If you wish to change Jape's home, then you will have to
   edit these files, or run the script installjape.sh again from the
   new home.
   
3. Press the Exit (and cleanup) button. This removes various bits of
   detritus from the bootstrap files that were generated during the
   installation.

   TROUBLESHOOTING: If you don't have java installed, and/or the java
   command is not on your path, then this will not work. Do whatever you
   need to do to get java installed and on your path. You don't need
   the whole jdk, just the java runtime environment.


3. Try running Jape, by (for example)

        ./Jape examples/sequent_calculus/SCS.jt

4. Please let us know that you've succeeded (or failed) by sending a short
   message of triumph (or despair) to

        richard@bornat.me.uk

   In case of despair, please send a log of your installation session and
   the attempted run of jape.
