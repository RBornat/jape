   How to run Jape
   -------------------

    You should have unpacked LinuxJape.tgz, and launched (double-click or bash) 
    installJape.sh. There should now remain an examples directory, README_HOW_TO_RUN_JAPE 
    (this file) and Jape.sh.

 1. Launch Jape.sh (double-click or bash). Jape will run and show its control window. From
    the File menu, open the Jape logic theory you want to work with (e.g. 
    examples/natural deduction/I2L.jt.)
   
 2. When Jape runs on Ubuntu, it will put its icon in the taskbar. Add it to your favourites
    (right-click and choose 'Add to Favourites') to make it easier to run Jape the next 
    time. 
   
 3. On other Linuxes, you may have to launch from the Jape.sh file each time you run Jape.
    If you find a better way, please let me know.
