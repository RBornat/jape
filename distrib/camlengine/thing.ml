let resnumbase = 1
(* In numbering resources the number passed in is the next free number.
 * We renumber starting with resnumbase, so no resource will have a smaller
 * number than that.
 *)
(* This function is about numbering rules, where we want to give resources
 * copied from consequent to antecedent the same number.  E.g. in
 * 
 *                      X |- _P  X |- _P->Q
 *                      ----------------- (->-E)
 *                             X |- Q
 *
 * all the elements (_P, _P->Q, Q) should have distinct numbers, but in
 *
 *                     X |- C  X, C |- B
 *                     ----------------- (cut)
 *                          X |- B
 *
 * the B in the top line should share a resource number with the B in the 
 * bottom line, and in
 *
 *                    X, Ax._P, _P[x\c] |- Q
 *                    -------------------- (A|-)
 *                      X, Ax._P |- Q
 *
 * the Qs should share a resource number, as should the Ax.Ps.  But 
 * inheritance should only be from bottom to top, so the Cs in the cut don't
 * share a resource number (is this what we want? I hope so).  Inheritance
 * is also only from left to left or right to right: if a formula appears on
 * one side in the consequent and the other in an antecedent, those instances
 * won't share a resource number.  Repeated resources do share numbers, as for
 * example in 
 *
 *                    X, B, B |- C
 *                    ------------ (contract |-)
 *                      X, B |- C
 *
 * If there is more than one occurrence of a formula on the same side of 
 * the consequent as, for example, in
 *
 *                    X, B |- C
 *                   ------------ (no name - never seen it )
 *                   X, B, B |- C
 *
 * then the algorithm won't give them the same number.  Hope all this is
 * what is needed -- expect experience to decide.
 *
 * RB 26/vii/96
 *)
(* Experience hasn't got very far yet, but it has discovered that it is 
 * necessary to number all things in the consequent with ResUnknowns, all 
 * similar things in the antecedents similarly and everything else with 
 * Resnums
 * RB 19/ix/96
 *)
(* Experience with multiplicative rules and drag-and-drop shows that it is
 * important that duplicated resources (as in contract) should be given
 * _different_ numbers.  This means that the interface implementation of
 * dNd has to be complicated (sigh).
 * RB 14/viii/97
