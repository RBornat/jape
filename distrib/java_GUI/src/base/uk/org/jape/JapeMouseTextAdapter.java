    Bernard's original ProofCanvas included this comment:
    
	This next spasm copes with the fact that Macs have 1-button
	mice, and that (in order to cope with this) Java AWT
	reports button 2 and button 3 presses AS IF they were
	presses with one of Meta or Alt pressed. I simply don't know
	whether the getButton field of an event on the Mac always
	says 1, or whether the lowlevel AWTery reports virtual
	buttons. Until I find out, I'm assuming the former, and using
	the Alt and Meta fields to give an indication of the button
	that was actually pressed (on nonMacs) or the (virtual) button
	that a MacIsta indicated that she wanted to press.
	
	Beyond here we're simply pretending we have a 3-button mouse.
    
    and this code:
    
	// Assigns the right virtual button for all but a move
	lastButton = 1;
	if (e.isAltDown())  lastButton=2;
	else
	if (e.isMetaDown()) lastButton=3;
    
    I'm using LocalSettings to get this right on different machines.

    It might be nice if click meant select me (as it does), and press-and-drag
    meant text-select me (as it doesn't for us, but it does in every editor).
    
    The drawbacks, apart from incompatibility with Actually Existing Jape, would
    be (a) impossible to select a token with a single click; (b) a modifier key /
    alternative button needed for drag-n-drop, when I come to it.
    
    But it doesn't work.  Essentially normal click (select, move when it's implemented)
    works on the whole object, text click (select ranges of text) works within the object.
    They are two different actions, and I shouldn't confuse them.  No doubt that was the
    reason for the original design ...
