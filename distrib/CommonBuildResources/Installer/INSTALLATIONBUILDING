HOW TO BUILD JAPE FOR A PARTICULAR MACHINE

1. For Unix builds be on some kind of Unix box to start with (Linux,
OS X, Solaris).  For Windows there are two ways: one that can be
done entirely on a Windows box (start reading Windows/README\
BUILD_FOR_WINDOWS.htm); the other can be done on a Unix box running
Windows on some kind of VM (start reading Windows/README-VM-BUILD.htm).

Make sure you've got OCaml, ant, and Java.

2. Get hold of a jape source distribution from the sourceforge jape
project (checkout the distrib repository from jape into a directory
of your choosing -- call it $D hereafter)

2a. cd $D/distrib
    sh CommonBuildResources/buildbuild.sh
    (cd CommonBuildResources/; make buildinstaller.jar)

3. To build a Linux version

        cd $D/distrib/LinuxJape/build 
        make distribution

-- it will build installLinuxJape.jar. Double-click that and follow the
prompts to install jape in a directory of your choice.

4. To build a Solaris version, just as Linux but SolarisJape/build
instead of LinuxJape/build

5. To build an OS X version, see $D/distrib/MacOSX/README_BUILD_MACOSX_JAPE.html

** Builds with ocaml 4.01 on both OS/X and Ubuntu 13.04 -- BS 5/iv/2014


Credits: Richard built the OS X bit and engineered the self-contained
Windows build. Bernard built the Unix build system (and a horribly
ad-hoc Windows build system) when we used to make and distribute the Solaris
and Linux and Windows versions at Oxford. We both did a bit of
maintenance on the rest.

History: 

  BS: Removed ancient Oxford-specific Windows build material (30/vii/2012).
