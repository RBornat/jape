Windows Jape installation
=========================

Revised December 2019


You will need
-------------

        A functioning java (9 or later) system. Oracle's standard jre
        is good enough -- you don't need the java development kit.

What to do
----------

0. Download the InstallWindowsjape.jar file to your system. 

1. Run the program InstallWindowsjape.jar by double clicking on it, or by
   whatever other means you normally use to start a java program
   packaged as a .jar file. [See TROUBLESHOOTING note 2 below]

   This will start executing the interactive java installer.

   The installer brings up a Splash Screen on which there are
   three buttons and a log window. 

2. Press the button labelled "Install".

   This unpacks the examples directory, and leaves the inference engine
   (jape.exe -- architecture dependent), the interface server (Jape.jar
   -- architecture independent). It then constructs a shortcut (Jape)
   that starts the jape program when it is opened/clicked. 
   
3. Press the Exit (and clean up) button

   TROUBLESHOOTING: 

   1. If you don't have java installed then this
   will not work. Do whatever you need to do to get java installed
   and on your path. You don't need the whole jdk, just the java
   runtime environment (jre -- obtainable from oracle.com)

   2. If you have installed software (such as WinRAR) that has
   registered .jar files for opening itself, then you will have
   to single-click on InstallWindowsjape.jar, then use the Open/With 
   menu entry to run the .jar as a java program.

   3. Clicking on the shortcut constructed by the installer is
   equivalent to executing the following command on a command line
   from the Jape installation directory:

        java -jar Jape.jar -engine jape.exe examples

   If you have trouble with the shortcut then try this as a last resort.


4. Try running jape then pressing "File/Open New Theory" and
   selecting (for example) the theory file

        examples/sequent_calculus/SCS.jt

   [[Do not press File/Open]]

5. Please let us know that you've succeeded (or failed) by sending a short
   message of triumph (or despair) to

        richard@bornat.me.uk

   In case of despair, please send a log of your installation session and
   the attempted run of jape.
