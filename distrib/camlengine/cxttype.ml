(* this information perhaps ought to be elsewhere in the proof state, but it's here
 * now, so what the hell.
 *
 * It records the 'exteriority' of a proof: information about the base judgment and 
 * the given judgements, which are where the proof touches the outside world.
 *
 * Exterior(ss*s,inf option,fvinf option):
 *   ss are the givens, s is the base sequent of the proof;
 *   inf is the rewinf of that collection of sequents;
 *   fvinf is information about the ways that names relate to each other, used
 *     to decide 'what dominates what', and some other stuff.  It consists of
 *       avs  : all variables in the exterior
 *       fvs  : all free variables in the exterior
 *       vmap : the 'what dominates what' mapping
 *       bhfvs: all free variables of base hypotheses
 *       bcfvs: all free variables of base conclusions
 *
 *       (I promise, one day, to write down what vmap is and how it's used.
 *        Until that day, look in facts.sml, where it's used.
 *       )
