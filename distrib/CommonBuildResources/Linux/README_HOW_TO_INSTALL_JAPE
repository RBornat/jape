   To install Jape, you must launch (or run) the file installJape.sh. 
   
   If double-clicking the file runs it, deletes Jape.app and this file, and leaves you with
   Jape.sh and README_HOW_TO_RUN_JAPE, then fine. 
   
   If not -- if double-clicking installJape.sh opens it in a text editor -- then there are 
   two things you can do.
   
   1. If you are using Ubuntu Linux, then you can tell it to run executable files when
      you double-click them. To make it do that, copy the following line into a Terminal
      window and press return:
      
          gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences executable-text-activation 'launch'
          
      Now you can double-click installJape.sh and it will run.
      
   2. If you don't want to do that, then in a Terminal window change directory (cd) to the
      directory containing installJape.sh, copy the following line into the Terminal
      window and press return:
      
          bash installJape.sh
          
   If you find a better way of running installJape.sh on your Linux, please let me know
   (address below).
