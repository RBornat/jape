# JreBundler
JreBundler is an Ant task which will create a Mac OS X application bundle from a jre and a main class name. You can add an Icon resource, set various Mac OS X native look-and-feel bells and whistles, and maintain your application bundles as part of your normal build and release cycle.

JreBundler draws extensively from JarBundler (https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler).
