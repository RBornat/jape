# Jape
Jape is a configurable proof calculator and supports the interactive discovery of formal proofs in inference systems. It is distributed with a number of example logic encodings: in particular a natural deduction, several sequent calculi, a treatment of Burroughs-Abadi-Newman protocols, a Hindley-Milner typing mechanism, and various others including even Aristotlean syllogisms. A manual ([Roll your own Jape logic](https://github.com/RBornat/jape/tree/master/dev/doc/manuals/roll_your_own)) is available for those who would like to experiment with their own encodings.

Get releases via [the release page](https://github.com/RBornat/jape/releases), and please report problems via [the issues page](https://github.com/RBornat/jape/issues).
