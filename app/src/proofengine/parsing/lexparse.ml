(* a little lex/parse mechanism, to support languages made up of the following stuff:
 *     brackets
 *     atoms
 *     strings (atoms with internal spaces, delimited by " ")
 *     comments (sml-style)
 * and nothing else. They don't have to be S-exprs, but that's an example of such a language. 
 *
 * It uses character streams, so it can handle strings and stuff. 
 * UTF-8 encoded Unicode chars won't confuse it.
