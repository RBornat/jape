/*  A Container to which you can add components at arbitrary positions

    Because of the way Container is implemented, especially the fact that
    (the important version of) findComponentAt is final, it's impossible to
    mess with the component hierarchy, so you have to have a child inside
    the container which holds the components you are drawing.  This doesn't
    matter, until you have to scan through the components and such.  So some
    users of this class have to be aware of the container/child distinction.
    Oh dear ...
 */

/*  I now realise that this thing has to be in a viewport, or it doesn't make any sense ... */

/* It no longer makes any sense to me. It took about a month to invent, I remember. I've been 
    several times round the loop, and each time I've concluded that I have to have two containers.
    But I can't remember why any longer.

    First it's essential to override contains, which (scandalously) requires that coordinate
    systems start at 0.

    paint is involved too.
