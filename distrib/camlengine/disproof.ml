(* The disproof calculator.  Commenced 4.vii.01. RB *)
(* It implements disproof in Kripke semantics (made classical by restriction to a single
   world, if necessary).  Predicates operate only on individuals, mostly because I don't
   yet understand terms.  It seems reasonable to me that if there is a disproof, then there
   is one which only uses individuals, so I'm not too unhappy.

 * force-state has ever been investigated. The body of a quantifier like All x.(P(x)->Q(x)),
 * for example, will never be evaluated -- though P(i)->Q(i), P(j)->Q(j), etc., will be.
 *
 * The map gives three-valued results; a forced function can only give two.
