BuildInstaller

<H1>
        A Unix/Windows Installer-Builder for Java programs
</H1>
<H2>
        Overview
</H2>
<P>

        BuildInstaller provides support for installing Jape (or any other
        java-based application) on any machine on which java is installed, and for
        building self-extracting ``jar'' archives. 
</P>

<P>
        It was originally designed and written in less than a working
        day, so there may be some aspects of its implementation to
        simplify and some aspects of its functionality to enhance,
        but for the moment it will do the job we need doing. It is
        small, and the facilities it offers are <B>minimal</B>.
</P>

<P>
        <I>For a considerably more refined installer kit see: 
        <A HREF="http://www.izforge.com/izpack/">The IzPack site</A></I>
</P>

<P>
        Our method is to build an (executable) jar file containing
        everything that the application needs, together with a
        primary bootstrap installer class whose main program gets
        executed from the jar.
</P>

<P>
        The primary bootstrap unpacks the jar in-situ at the
        installation site, before loading and instantiating a
        designated secondary bootstrap that can be written in
        java, or can be a shell script.
</P>

<P>
        The point of building an executable jar is that some Windows
        java installations will let one execute a jar file by
        double-clicking on it -- this saves the poor installer from
        having to find out how to get java to work on a command line,
        and/or finding a way of unpacking a jar and/or making a windows shortcut
        to an executable.
</P>

<H2>To build an installer</H2>

<P>
        Construct the resources you need for your application to work; place them
        in suitably-named folders/directories and files, then

        
<PRE>
                java  -jar buildinstaller.jar $(TARGET).jar [-<I>switch</I> parameter | <I>filename</I>]
</PRE>
        or, if you have installed the build installer command,
<PRE>
                buildinstaller $(TARGET).jar [-<I>switch</I> parameter | <I>filename</I>]
</PRE>

</P>

<P>
        This builds a self-installing jar called $(TARGET)<code>.jar</code> that can be
        transported to any machine on which Java has been installed already. 
</P>

        
<H2>
        To use the resulting installer on Windows 
</H2>

<P>
        To use the resulting installer on a Windows machine,
        on which java has been properly installed (only the
        jre is needed, not the whole jdk) just doubleclick on
        $(TARGET)<code>.jar</code>.  A control panel appears which
        gives you the option to install the software beneath the
        directory from which the command was run, or of choosing
        a new installation folder.
</P>
<P>
        It's usually possible to arrange to create runtime
        scripts, and to make shortcuts to them with the appropriate
        icons within. The <code>-autoinstall</code> does this
        without too much trouble.
</P>
          
<H2>
        To use the resulting installer on Unix (or a Windows command-line)
</H2>

<P>
        To use the resulting installer on a Unixoid machine,
        on which java has been properly installed, (only
        the jre is needed, not the whole jdk), just run the
        $(TARGET)<code>.jar</code> by a command such as the following
</P>
        
<PRE>
                java -jar $(TARGET).jar
</PRE>
The following command turns on maximal monitoring at install-time, which can be useful
<PRE>
                java -jar -DEBUG $(TARGET).jar
</PRE>

<P>
        A control panel appears which gives you the option
        to install the software beneath the directory from
        which the command was run, or of choosing a new
        installation folder.
</P>

<P>
        It's usually possible to arrange to create runtime
        scripts, and to make shortcuts to them with the appropriate
        icons within. The <code>-autoinstall</code> does this
        without too much trouble.
</P>

<H2>
        Behaviour of the Installer Builder
</H2>
<P>
        Filename (or folder name) arguments specify files that are
        part of the permanent installation. At install-time they
        are shipped (in their entirety in the case of folders)
        to the installation folder -- the directory prefix of the
        ``source'' file or folder is replaced with the name of
        the installation folder.  (The <code>-boot</code> switch
        modifies this behaviour slightly: see below)
</P>

<H2>
        Switches are:
</H2>

<PRE>
   -debug                                      -- Turns on maximal monitoring at installer-construction time
   -app           "the app name"               -- (not very optional) default is Jape
   -java          "min required java version"  -- (optional)  comment to made in the visible log as the installer runs
   -splash        <I>image file</I>                   -- (optional)  the installation splash image (should be a GIF or PNG)
   -splashside    West, East or North          -- (optional)  which side of the screen the splash image is placed on (default North)
   -installdir    <I>folder name</I>         --  the (default) path to the folder into which the software will be installed
                                          This is relative to the path from which the installer is executed, and can be
                                          changed at install-time.
</PRE>


<H2>
       Switches that define automated post-install processing (Windows and Unix)
</H2>
<PRE>
   -autoinstall  <I>appname</I>         -- arrange to install (and construct a shortcut to, where appropriate)
                                    the application executable as <I>appname</I>.
   -autoicon     <I>icon filename</I>   -- the icon file to be used for the Windows shortcut
                                    (optional)
   -comment      <I>stuff</I>           -- (optional: default is the app name) comment to attach to the symbolic link (Windows)
   -autojar      <I>filename</I>        -- (optional) the name of the jar 
                                    (default is <I>appname</I><code>.jar</code> as set by <code>-autoinstall</code>)
                                    <I>(The named jar file is shipped automatically)</I>
</PRE>
        Arguments to the following switches are subject to the substitutions described later.
<PRE>
                                    
   -autocmd      <I>filename</I>        -- (optional) (Windows) if specified, is the name of a command file that will
                                    run the jar; otherwise we construct a shortcut directly to the jar.
   -autowork     <I>filename</I>        -- (optional) (Windows) if specified, is the name of the working directory in which the
                                    application will open.
   -explore      <I>command</I>         -- (optional) (Windows) command run in windows when the installation has finished.
</PRE>
        Arguments to the following switches are subject to the substitutions described later, as well
        as having %JAR% replaced by the aboslute path to the jar file
<PRE>   
   -windowsrun   <I>command</I>         -- (optional) (Windows)  The windows command used to run the program.
                                    (default) javaw.exe -jar "%JAR%" %*%
   -unixrun      <I>command</I>         -- (optional) (Unix)     The shell command used to run the program.
                                    (default) exec java -jar "%JAR%" "$@"
</PRE>

<H2>
       Switches that define post-install shortcut installation (Windows only)
</H2>
<P>
        Up to 20 shortcuts can be installed by using the following switches. In the descriptions below <I>n</I>
        is a number between 1 and 20. Arguments are subject to the substitutions described later.
</P>
<PRE>
        -shortcut<I>n</I>  <I>filename</I>    Install a shortcut with the given <I>filename</I>
        -to<I>n</I>        <I>filename</I>    The shortcut points to the given filename (it may be a program)
</PRE>   
The remaining shortcut-modifying switches are optional
<PRE>
        -icon<I>n</I>      <I>filename</I>    The shortcut uses the given file as its icon
        -args<I>n</I>      <I>arguments</I>   The shortcut is to a running program; it uses the given arguments
                                      (surround arguments that may have filenames in them with apostrophes;
                                       these are converted to double quotes within the shortcut)
        -dir<I>n</I>       <I>foldername</I>  The shortcut is to a running program; it starts in the given folder 
        -comment<I>n</I>   <I>text</I>        Associate the text with the shortcut as a comment
</PRE>

<H2>
Substitutions
</H2>
<PRE>
        %INSTALL%               -- the installation folder
        %DESKTOP-COMMON%        -- the common desktop folder
        %PROGRAMS-COMMON%       -- the common programs folder
        %DESKTOP%               -- the installing user's desktop
        %PROGRAMS%              -- the installing user's programs
        %DOCUMENTS%             -- the installing user's ``My Documents'' folder
        %PROGRAM-FILES%         -- the system's ``Program Files'' folder
</PRE>


<H2>
       Switches that affect the captions on various buttons and other GUI aspects
</H2>
<PRE>
   -choosebutton  "<I>caption</I>"      -- (optional)  the folder-selection dialogue start button   ("Choose Installation Folder")
   -setbutton     "<I>caption</I>"      -- (optional)  the folder-selection dialogue confirm button ("Set Installation Folder")
   -label         "<I>caption</I>"      -- (optional)  the caption placed beside the folder name    ("Installation Folder")
   -exit          "<I>caption</I>"      -- (optional)  the initial caption on the exit button       ("Exit without installing")
   -finished      "<I>caption</I>"      -- (optional)  the post-install caption on the exit button  ("Exit (and cleanup) now")
   -desktop       "<I>caption</I>"      -- (optional)  the caption on the ``Shortcut'' checkbox     ("Shortcut on Desktop"/"Executable in $HOME/bin")
   -installbutton "<I>caption</I>"      -- (optional)  the caption on the start installation button ("Install")
   -bfont         <I>fontname</I>       -- (optional)  button font                                  (default Sanserif-PLAIN-14)
   -tfont         <I>fontname</I>       -- (optional)  feedback window font                         (default Monospaced-PLAIN-14)
</PRE>
          

<H2>Installation-specific Cleanup</H2>
The bootstrap directory and other ``junk'' is cleaned-up automatically on exit from the installer, but there may be
files in the distribution jar file that are relevant only for a specific type of operating system. Specific
arrangements have to be made to delete these. The appropriate switches are:
<PRE>
   -delunix      -- subsequent files are to be deleted during clean-up after a unix install
   -delwindows   -- subsequent files are to be deleted during clean-up after a windows install
</PRE>

<H2>
       Low-level post-install scripts and commands 
</H2>
<PRE>
   -cmdunix       "command"           --  the post-unpack shell command for Unixoid systems
   -cmdwindows    "command"           --  the post-unpack shell command for Windoid systems
   -cmdunix1      "command"           --  the second post-unpack shell command for Unixoid systems
   -cmdwindows1   "command"           --  the second post-unpack shell command for Windoid systems
   -classwindows  <I>class name</I>          --  the post-unpack class to load and instantiate (on Windows)
   -classunix     <I>class name</I>          --  the post-unpack class to load and instantiate (on non-Windows)
   -class         <I>class name</I>          --  the post-unpack class to load and instantiate (everywhere)
</PRE>

<ul>
<li>
        The switches <code>-cmd</code><I>XXX</I> are normally deprecated, although: <code>-cmdwindows 'explore %INSTALL%'</code>
        might be a useful one to try.
</li>
<li>
        The values of the arguments of <TT>-cmd</TT><I>XXX</I> are transformed, before they are executed,
        by substituting the path to the installation folder for all occurences of the string <code>%INSTALL%</code>.
</li>
<li>
        The classes specified by <TT>-class</TT><I>XXX</I> are loaded and instantiated before the scripts/commands
        specified by <code>-cmd</code><I>XXX</I> are run. The <code>.class</code> file for the classes is automatically
        shipped (and deleted during the cleanup phase). 
</li>
<li>
        Any switches that the installer builder does not recognise are paired with the next 
        parameter to the builder and put into the ``property'' environment that is passed to
        the post-install phase. Most other builder parameters can be found there as well.
</li>
</ul>
<pre>
        import java.util.*;
        
        /**
                This is a skeletal post-install class
        */
        
        public class postinstall 
        { 
          public void run(String install, Properties props)     // This method must be defined          
          { System.err.println("Install:    "+install);          
            System.err.println("Properties: "+props);           
          }
        }
</pre>


<H2>
       Switches that modify the way resource files are treated
</H2>
<PRE>
   -sync         -- synchronize and ship the files which follow as if they came from 
                    the directory in which the installation is being 
                    constructed (not usually needed).
   -boot         -- ship the files and folders that follow into the 
                    <TT>%INSTALL%/bootstrap</TT> directory (for use by low-level
                    post-install scripts and classes). This directory is removed
                    at ``clean-up'' time.
   +sync         -- turns off -sync  (obsolete: meaningless)
   +boot         -- turn  off -boot  (obsolete: implied by all switches other than -boot)
</PRE>

<H2>
        TO DO
</H2>

<P>
        It would be simpler and better if this class were split into
        the bootstrap-builder and the primary bootstrap installer,
        but the overhead of the builder being present at install
        time is small anway.
</P>
<P>
        I may need to add something for MacOSX installation.
</P>

<h2>
        Additional requirements
</h2>
<ul>
        <li>
        The system on which the installation will take place must be capable of executing
        a java program packed in a <code>.jar</code> file. On a Unix system this
        is straightforward, on a Windows system the <code>.jar</code> file extension must be
        associated with the java runtime (rather than some archiving program, as sometimes happens).
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        Example: the following (Unix) shell command builds the buildinstaller distribution jar
</h2>
<pre>
        java -jar buildinstaller.jar                    \
                InstallBuildInstaller.jar               \
                installer.html                          \       
                -app            "Build Installer"       \
                -java           "any java version greater than 9" \
                -autoinstall    buildinstaller          \
                -autojar        buildinstaller.jar
